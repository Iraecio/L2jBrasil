!Guard Ronde:

Dion now looks like a poor town, but it was originally a very prosperous territory.

The wheat harvested from the wide plain of Dion was the primary source of wealth.

However, there was a war over possession of this plain, and the taxes soared.

Rebellions followed, and now Dion is one of the poorest territories in the kingdom.

I hope something can be done about it.
